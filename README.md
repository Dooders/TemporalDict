# TemporalDict

The TemporalDict is a custom implementation of a dictionary that tracks changes over time, allowing you to access past states of the dictionary. It is designed to provide version control for dictionary-like data structures, making it ideal for applications that require historical data tracking, state buffering, and temporal data analysis.

The primary purpose of the TemporalDict class is to enable users to record and retrieve different states of a dictionary at various points in time. This is particularly useful for scenarios where understanding the evolution of data or the ability to revert to previous states is crucial.
