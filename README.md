# TemporalObject

The TemporalObject is a custom implementation of an object that tracks changes over time, allowing you to access past states of the object. It is designed to provide version control for dictionary-like data structures, making it ideal for applications that require historical data tracking, state buffering, and temporal data analysis.

The primary purpose of the TemporalObject class is to enable users to record and retrieve different states of an object at various points in time. This is particularly useful for scenarios where understanding the evolution of data or the ability to revert to previous states is crucial.
